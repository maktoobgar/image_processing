# Question

How phones' cameras work these days?

# Answer

Phones' cameras work by using three basic parts: the lens, the sensor, and the software. The lens directs light into the camera, the sensor converts the focused photons of light into an electrical signal, and the software converts those electrical signals into an image. To make cameras better, manufacturers use various techniques such as image stabilization, optical and electronic zoom, and advanced image processing algorithms.

## Hardware (ISP or Image Signal Processor)

Phones' cameras use an Image Signal Processor (ISP) as a specialized component to process raw image data captured by the camera and convert it into a high-quality image. The ISP performs various functions such as demosaicing, denoising, color correction, and auto functions that help deliver an enhanced image. The ISP is responsible for implementing hybrid focusing operations such as phase, laser, and contrast, and providing support for multiple cameras. The ISP also controls autofocus, exposure, and white balance for the camera system. The ISP is an essential component in modern embedded vision applications, responsible for processing the high-resolution images on advanced cameras. The ISP is programmable, and different chips or different products using the same chip also have obvious differences in shooting performance. The new algorithm after debugging in different ways will widen the gap with the integrated original algorithm. The importance of ISP lies in its ability to enhance the quality of digital images, making them more appealing and usable.

## Image Processing Algorithms

Image processing algorithms are used in smartphones' cameras to improve the visual quality of photographs taken by users. Some of the commonly used image processing algorithms include image stabilization, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range), Smart HDR, and Night mode. Image stabilization compensates for camera shake and movement, while noise reduction reduces the amount of noise in an image. HDR and Smart HDR merge multiple images taken at different exposure levels to improve the dynamic range of the image. Night mode uses a variation of the HDR technique to capture different images of the same subject at varying exposure levels and then combines them to expand the dynamic range of the photo. These algorithms work together with the hardware components of the camera to provide a better camera experience.

### Image Stablization

Phones' cameras use image stabilization algorithms to improve the visual quality of photographs taken by users. Image stabilization compensates for camera shake and movement, which can be caused by hand-held photography or other shaky scenarios. There are two types of image stabilization: optical image stabilization (OIS) and electronic image stabilization (EIS). OIS uses a floating lens element that moves to counteract camera shake, while EIS uses software algorithms to stabilize the image after it has been captured. Both types of image stabilization work together with the hardware components of the camera to provide a better camera experience. In addition to image stabilization, other commonly used image processing algorithms include noise reduction, HDR, Smart HDR, and Night mode. These algorithms work together with the hardware components of the camera to provide a better camera experience.

### Noise Reduction

Noise reduction is a common image processing algorithm used in smartphones' cameras to improve the visual quality of photographs taken by users. Noise reduction smooths the dots of color and tone in an image, reducing sharpness. There are many different types of noise, and the most visible noise is the random variation of brightness or color information in images. Some degree of electronic noise is present in any electronic device that transmits or receives a signal. The noise reduction algorithm reduces the amount of noise in an image, but strong noise reduction can also blur fine textures and reduce detail. The noise reduction algorithm works together with the hardware components of the camera to provide a better camera experience. There are many techniques to reduce noise, such as multi-frame noise reduction (MFNR), which merges multiple images taken within short intervals under the same capture parameter. Other techniques include using a long exposure camera app, manual control of the camera, and using photo editing apps such as Snapseed and Adobe Lightroom mobile.
